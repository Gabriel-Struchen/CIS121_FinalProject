In this program we recreated the full game of blackjack
We used classes for:
  The deck of cards
  the player
  the dealer
We then used functions to to enable the player to make decisions about what moves they would like to do:
  Hit
  Stand
  Split
  Double-Down
  Surrender
We used a text file to store the player's available funds and write their available funds after a game back as well
